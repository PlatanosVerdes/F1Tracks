This is a website where you can find and consult all the F1 circuits of the 2022 season and previous ones.

This page is a practice for a subject, they made us use the data of the page from a JSON file, therefore, when you visit the page it may be outdated.

The entire page is used in pure JavaScript, html and css. It has been made a bit more enjoyable using boostrap.
